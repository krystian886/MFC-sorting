# Description
This is a simple programme using MS MFC library that creates single document solution.

<br>

To set the params of the sorting operation, a dialog window is implemented and hidden
behind the "S" icon - or menu: Sort -> properties.

<br>

Its use is trivial, so without further ado, simple example:
![start](./img/3.png)
<br>
![start](./img/4.png)
<br>

Heap & Quick sorts are too fast, so once again but with bigger array:

<br>

Everytime user inserts new data in dialog window and presses OK, the algorithms go to work
<br>
<b>BUT</b>
<br>
if the array is too small 
<br>
(working time <= 0.001 sec)
<br>
<b>OR</b>
<br>
none of the methods are checked, 
<br>
main window will just clear itself and wait for further instructions
